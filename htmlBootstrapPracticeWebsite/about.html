          <h1>About Us</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="py-4">
          <p>
            Founded in 2004, Pinstorm is one of the oldest and most experienced
            independent digital-first marketing firms in South Asia. It is also
            among faster-growing digital marketing and advertising agencies in
            the region.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Pinstorm innovated a completely fresh and bold approach to brand
            building in the digital era. The firm’s focus is to work with
            marketers on a different philosophy, to start with trying to improve
            the marketer’s digital product offering so that it can have positive
            digital word of mouth. And then moving to help grow it using a suite
            of other tactics.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Pinstorm’s unique process is summed up in the mnemonic ASPIRE, which
            starts with Absorbing all public sentiments about the brand and its
            competition, then Solving issues that the marketer’s customers have
            highlighted on digital, then Planning based on a read of customer
            sentiments as well as market movements, followed by Ideation to
            create news-making content and advertising on the desired strategy,
            which would then be amplified by Radiating the message using paid
            media to its targeted prospects – and to do it all Endlessly, as
            marketing is increasingly a round-the-clock activity in a
            digital-first world.
          </p>
         
          <p>
            This mix of digital research, sentiment analysis, reputation
            management, strategy, creativity, media management and a global
            outlook is what brands increasingly need every aspect of – and one
            that Pinstorm pioneered in the early 2000s. This leads to the core
            advantage where Pinstorm believes its clients can win over their
            competition by out-smarting them and not necessarily outspending
            them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Pinstorm’s approach in practice integrates SMO strategy, research,
            user experience, web design, mobile-friendliness, advertising,
            search optimization, analytics, viral videos, Facebook campaigns,
            Twitter updates, real-time listening and responses as a seamless set
            of tactics in a result-focused custom-built manner.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Pinstorm helps grow brands through consulting, advertising, digital
            marketing, product design, custom software development, training,
            continuous mentoring and whatever the clients need to win
            comprehensively in their markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the approach, Pinstorm’s uniqueness stems from its
            product licensing solutions, which form a significant part of its
            revenues. In a market where some offer products only and others
            offer services only, Pinstorm has a approach that offers both.
          </p>
    
          <p><b>Around the consumer. Around the world. Around the clock.</b></p>
          <p>
            We’ve heard it all before. Integrated marketing. 360-degree
            approach. Permission marketing. Digital marketing. Cause marketing.
            Engagement marketing. Connected marketing. Content as marketing.
            One-to-one marketing. Glocal marketing.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Every day seems to bring another approach, another buzzword, another
            label, another short-lived bestselling business book from another
            author who is never heard from again.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Perhaps that’s the very issue. Many of us lived our marketing lives
            in the 20th century under the benign and consensual hallucination
            that Kotler had it all covered. Then came the internet, the set-top
            box, e-commerce, new logistics, 3D printers, social networks and
            suddenly Kotler’s 4Ps seem as contemporary as the Bible on astronomy
            before being rudely corrected by Galileo.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The only issue is that there’s no Galileo here yet. No new
            widely-accepted Way How Marketing Works. And there may not be, for
            some time yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps we’re going through some sort of Cambrian explosion in
            marketing, with a new technique, a new theory, a new differentiated
            species of product launch campaign being born every day. Some will
            make it through, some will not. But it’ll take decades to settle
            down into anything predictable and stable. If at all it does, that
            is.
          </p>
          
          <p>Till then, we can’t stop marketing, of course. That’s silly.</p>
          <p>
            But it’s just as silly to continue to market with ways that we know
            that do not work. We know that the two pillars of traditional
            advertising – big-budget television commercials with big agency
            mark-ups – driven by big-budget media buys with big agency
            kickbacks, both do not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The low cost of creating great video for YouTube along with the
            transparency in buying Google and Facebook have put paid to the
            old-school way of doing things.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not about back-room deals with back-room guys any more. It’s
            not about TV production markups or media kickbacks either. So what
            is it about?
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a glimmer of a clue, but we don’t know for sure either. We
            started in the era when search was big, grew at a time when display
            came of age, matured with social networks and YouTube, and now see
            equations change again with what seems to be the decline of the
            Facebook age. And we’re just 10 years old. More has changed in these
            10 years than in the 50 years before.
          </p>
          
          <p>We don’t have a magic prescription for you.</p>
          
          <p>
            But what we do know is this: it’s a time to be flexible. It’s a time
            to be agile. It’s a time when your technical chops play a big role.
            When your brand should have the ability to listen every minute of
            every day, and react in minutes. To build an app one day, project on
            walls another. To create channels on YouTube, fight Facebook’s
            limits on virality, compose music one month and make a movie in
            another. Create buzz on-ground and measure it online. Change the way
            you do your budgets. Change what your people measure. And, through
            all this, be guided by people who are neither trying to sell you
            media, nor TV production.
          </p>
          <p>As the world changes, brands need to change to be in sync.</p>
          <p>
            More importantly, the companies behind the brands need to change
            just as rapidly. Marketing processes need to change. People need to
            be re-trained, they need new frameworks, new metrics, new KRAs.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This isn’t the time for a mainline agency or a digital agency or a
            creative agency or a media agency.
          </p>
          <p>It’s the time for a transformation agency.</p>
