        <p>
        <p>We’re in a world that changes by the minute, where free media has greater reach and credibility than paid
            media and where prospects talk about you and your competition 24 by 7.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a world where not just desktops and mobile phones – but TV programs, billboards and newspapers are
            going digital.

        </p>
        <p>A world where industrial era practices of command-and-control or even Kotler-type 4P approaches simply don’t
            cut it anymore. A world that demands a different kind of business and brand thinking. At Pinstorm, what we
            offer is a completely new approach to building your brand in this digital age. An approach driven by a
            different philosophy – where we believe innovating on the product offering can be far more impactful than
            innovating in TV commercials, and where we think outsmarting the competition is a better thing to do than
            outspending them.</p>

        <p>An approach that sees strategy, research, user experience, web design, mobile-friendliness, advertising,
            search optimization, viral videos, Facebook campaigns, Twitter updates, real-time listening and responses as
            a seamless set of tactics that stem from one overarching brand strategy. An approach that has helped our
            clients win comprehensively in their markets. Do read about what we believe in, see the work we’ve done,
            hear what our clients have to say, explore some of the technologies we’ve developed and if we do interest
